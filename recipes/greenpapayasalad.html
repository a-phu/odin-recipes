        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Thai salad – called Som Tum – is a riot of fresh colours and crunchy textures, brought to life with a signature sour-sweet-savoury dressing spiked with a whack of fresh chilli. </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp garlic </li>
            <li>6 bird eye chillies</li>
            <li>6 tbsp dried shrimp</li>
            <li>1 cup palm sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup lime juice</li>
            <li>1 cup roasted peanuts</li>
            <li>20 snake beans</li>
            <li>3 cups grape tomato</li>
            <li>500g / 4 cups green papaya</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Thai basil leaves </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crush peanuts: Place peanuts in a mortar and pestle. Pound lightly to break them up into largish pieces, not into powder. Transfer to bowl.</li>
            <li>Garlic and chilli paste: Place garlic and chilli in the mortar. Pound into a paste. Add shrimp and pound to crush them – no need to grind them to a paste.</li>
            <li>Dressing: Stir in palm sugar, lime and fish sauce until sugar dissolves. Pour Dressing into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Bruise snake beans: Add snake beans to mortar (in batches if needed). Pound to bruise, split and soften (they are raw, so they need to be bashed to soften). Add to Dressing.</li>
            <li>Crush tomato: Grab handfuls of tomato, crush with your hands then add into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Add papaya: Add papaya and 3/4 of the peanuts. Toss well with 2 wooden spoons or tongs.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
