        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cross between Chili  and Mac and Cheese, all made in one pot.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>
            <li>1 red capsicum / bell pepper</li>
            <li>500g / 1 lb ground beef (mince)</li>
            <li>1 red capsicum / bell pepper</li>
            <li>800g / 28 oz crushed canned tomato</li>
            <li>420g / 14 oz can red kidney beans</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (625 ml) beef broth</li>
            <li>250g / 8 oz elbow macaroni pasta </li>
            <li>2 cups (200g) shredded cheese </li>
            <li>1/4 cup coriander / cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in large pot over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 minute. Then add capsicum and cook until onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go.</li>
            <li>Once the beef turns from red to brown, add remaining ingredients except cheese. Stir, bring to simmer, then turn the heat down to medium.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for 12 minutes or until the macaroni is al dente, meaning just cooked, still a tiny bit on the firm side. It should be saucy but not tons of liquid</li>
            <li>Turn the stove OFF but leave the pot on the stove. Stir through half the cheese â€“ it should be a bit saucy. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Top with remaining cheese, put the lid back on and leave until the cheese melts - about 2 minutes (sauce will absorb further during this period).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with coriander, if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
